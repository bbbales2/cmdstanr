\title{Get or set the file path to the CmdStan installation}
\usage{
set_cmdstan_path(path = NULL)

cmdstan_path()

cmdstan_version()
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The full file path to the CmdStan installation as a string. If
\code{NULL} (the default) then the path is set to the default path used by
\code{\link[=install_cmdstan]{install_cmdstan()}} if it exists.}
}
\value{
A string. Either the file path to the CmdStan installation or the
CmdStan version number.
}
\description{
Use the \code{set_cmdstan_path()} function to tell CmdStanR where the
CmdStan installation in located. Once the path has been set,
\code{cmdstan_path()} will return the full path to the CmdStan installation and
\code{cmdstan_version()} will return the CmdStan version number. See \strong{Details}
for how to avoid manually setting the path in each \R session.
}
\details{
Before the package can be used it needs to know where the CmdStan
installation is located. When the package is loaded it tries to help automate
this to avoid having to manually set the path every session:
\itemize{
\item If the \link[=Sys.setenv]{environment variable} \code{"CMDSTAN"} exists at load time
then its value will be automatically set as the default path to CmdStan for
the \R session.
\item If no environment variable is found when loaded but the directory
\code{".cmdstanr/cmdstan"} exists in the user's home directory
(\code{Sys.getenv("HOME")}, \emph{not} the current working directory) then it will
be set as the path to CmdStan for the \R session. This is the same as the
default directory that \code{\link[=install_cmdstan]{install_cmdstan()}} would use to install the latest
version of CmdStan.
}

It is always possible to change the path after loading the package using
\code{set_cmdstan_path(path)}.
