\usage{
install_cmdstan(dir = NULL, cores = 2, quiet = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE, repo_clone = FALSE,
  repo_url = "https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan.git",
  repo_branch = "develop")
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Path to the directory in which to install CmdStan. The default is
to install it in a directory called \code{.cmdstanr} within the user's home
directory (i.e, \code{file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".cmdstanr")}).}

\item{cores}{The number of CPU cores to use to parallelize building CmdStan
and speed up installation. The default is \code{cores=2}, although we recommend
using more cores if available.}

\item{quiet}{Should the verbose output from the system process be suppressed
during installation? The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{overwrite}{When an existing installation is found in \code{dir}, should
CmdStan still be downloaded and reinstalled? The default is \code{FALSE}, in
which case an informative error is thrown instead of overwriting the user's
installation.}

\item{repo_clone}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), the latest CmdStan release is
downloaded and installed from tarball. If \code{TRUE} will install a git clone
of CmdStan from \code{repo_url} and check out the branch \code{repo_branch}.}

\item{repo_url}{If \code{repo_clone} is \code{TRUE}, the URL of the git repository to
clone. The default URL points to the
\href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan}{stan-dev/cmdstan}
repository on GitHub.}

\item{repo_branch}{If \code{repo_clone} is \code{TRUE}, the name of the branch to
checkout in the cloned repository.}
}
\value{
\link[base:invisible]{Invisibly}, the list returned by \code{\link[processx:run]{processx::run()}},
which contains information about the system process that was run. See the
\strong{Value} section at \code{\link[processx:run]{processx::run()}} for details.

The \code{install_cmdstan()} function runs a script
(see \code{inst/make_cmdstan.sh} on \href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr}{GitHub})
that by default attempts to download and install the latest release of
\href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest}{CmdStan}. Currently the
necessary C++ tool chain is assumed to be available (see Appendix B of the
CmdStan \href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest}{guide}),
but in the future CmdStanR may help install the requirements.
