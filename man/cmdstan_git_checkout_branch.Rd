\title{Check out a branch from a git repository and rebuild CmdStan}
\usage{
cmdstan_git_checkout_branch(repo_branch, clean_and_rebuild = TRUE,
  cores = 2, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{repo_branch}{If \code{repo_clone} is \code{TRUE}, the name of the branch to
checkout in the cloned repository.}

\item{clean_and_rebuild}{If \code{TRUE} (the default), will run \code{make clean-all}
and \code{make build} after checking out the new branch.}

\item{cores}{The number of CPU cores to use to parallelize building CmdStan
and speed up installation. The default is \code{cores=2}, although we recommend
using more cores if available.}

\item{quiet}{Should the verbose output from the system process be suppressed
during installation? The default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\link[base:invisible]{Invisibly}, the list returned by \code{\link[processx:run]{processx::run()}},
which contains information about the system process that was run. See the
\strong{Value} section at \code{\link[processx:run]{processx::run()}} for details.
}
\description{
This only works if the installed CmdStan is from a clone of the git
repository. See \link{install_cmdstan} for more details.
