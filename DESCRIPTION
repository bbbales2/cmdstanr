Description: A lightweight interface to 'Stan' <https://mc-stan.org>. 
    The 'CmdStanR' interface to 'Stan' (the 'cmdstanr' R package) calls
    'CmdStan' (the shell interface) for compilation, running algorithms, 
    and writing results to files. Methods for accessing the results
    from R are also provided.
